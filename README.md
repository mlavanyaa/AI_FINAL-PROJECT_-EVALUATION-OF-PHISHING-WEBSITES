AI_Final_Project

Phishing refers to a deceptive procedure when an attacker tries to get the victim to divulge sensitive information. These assaults are typically carried out using websites, texts, or emails. Nowadays, phishing websites are on the rise and seem exactly like real websites. On the other hand, the victim's submitted sensitive data is collected by their backend. The machine learning community, which has developed the models and carried out classifications of phishing websites, has recently become interested in finding and detecting phishing websites. The goal of our project is to analyze and identify phishing websites based on their URLs. Two datasets from Mendaly Data for phishing websites, each with 89,000 and 59,000 rows, are included in this research. When performing the URL-based analysis, numerous elements are taken into account for analysis, including the number of redirects, the response time for a domain query, etc. With the use of our technology, one may quickly determine whether a website is a phishing website or not by simply inputting the URL of that website. This project has the following benefits: • It can be used to extract intriguing patterns from the provided data. • Information is gathered about the factors that are important in determining whether a website is a phishing website. • A machine learning model is created to predict whether or not the URL leads to a phishing website.

If a user has a Jupyter notebook installed on their computer, the code is rather straightforward and can be simply run on that device. This code uses a neural network, thus there is a minimal need to run it. The needed hardware and software are listed below:


Windows 10 Jupyter Notebook software Python


Hardware: 8GB of RAM Intel i5 processor; 4GB graphics

These are the prerequisites, but if your computer does not meet them, you do not need to worry; you can still run the program on a machine with a lower configuration, it will simply take a bit longer than usual.

Please keep in mind that this code just serves as the backend for detecting phishing websites; a suitable frontend GUI is required for professional use.

Discover and delight.
